# VBA StockAnalysis Challenge

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

the purpose of this project was the evalute the most efficient way to run 2017 and 2018 stock data. We want to see if and how refactored code is better than the original data we used 

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2018 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

![2017 Time](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113560850/197076809-20f5292e-7f2f-4924-badf-cab5c38a6533.png)
![2018 Data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113560850/197076831-496af764-7b07-4346-a7db-6ae0d6ab0e99.png)
![2018 Time](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113560850/197076843-d56701a4-6476-4c55-91e1-a041cdd2a7b1.png)

from the images above, it is evident that 2017 stocks faired much better than 2018 stocks. Of all stocks the only one that perfomed worse consistently was the TERP stock.
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

Refactoring gives us a better way to run code in a more time efficient time. This saves us alot of time rather than just rewriting all of the code. However there could be problems when the code we want starts to become more nuanced and more changes are neeed to the overall structure of the code to extract what we need. 


How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
in context of the project, we were able to just re use code. The problem is that they weren't exactly the same so we ran into some problems.
